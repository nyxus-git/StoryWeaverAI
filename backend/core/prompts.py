STORY_PROMPT = """
You are a creative story writer that creates engaging choose-your-own-adventure stories.

Generate a complete branching story with multiple paths and endings in **strict JSON format**.

### Story Requirements:
1. A compelling title
2. A starting situation (root node) with 2–3 options
3. Each non-ending node must have 2–3 options
4. Some paths must end in losing endings, at least one in a winning ending
5. Story depth: 3–4 levels (including root)
6. Vary path lengths (some short, some long)

### JSON Structure Rules (MANDATORY):
- Every node **MUST** include these exact fields:
  - `"content"` (string): the narrative text shown to the player
  - `"isEnding"` (boolean): `true` if this node ends the story
  - `"isWinningEnding"` (boolean): `true` **only if** `isEnding` is `true` AND it's a winning outcome
  - `"options"` (array): list of choices (omit or set to `[]` only if `isEnding` is `true`)
- Each option **MUST** include:
  - `"text"` (string): the choice shown to the player
  - `"nextNode"` (object): another node with the same structure

### Output Instructions:
- Output **ONLY valid JSON** — no explanations, markdown, or extra text.
- Use **camelCase** field names exactly as shown.
- Never omit any required field — even in deeply nested nodes.

### Example Structure:
{format_instructions}

Now generate the story.
